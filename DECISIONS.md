# Decisions
<!-- IMPORTANT: Load CONSTRAINTS.md and DESIGN.md alongside this
file at every session start. Constraints listed in CONSTRAINTS.md are binding regardless of what is recorded here. Design identity in DESIGN.md informs all gallery
options regardless of session context. -->

## Project Profile

<!-- Operational details for this project. Kept here, not in AGENTS.md,
     to keep the root instruction file framework-agnostic and safe to
     publish. Do not put credentials, hostnames, file paths, or API
     keys here — those belong in .env.

     An agent fills this section during Phase 1 by asking the person
     plain-language questions. If this section is empty, ask before
     writing any code. See AGENTS.md → Detect the Framework. -->

- **Stack:** No-framework PHP site with shared route handling in `public/index.php`.
- **Deployment:** PHP-capable static/shared hosting or PHP built-in server for local preview.
- **Database:** None.
- **Version pins:** None.
- **Framework AGENTS.md:** No framework-specific AGENTS.md exists — sessions follow root AGENTS.md only.
- **Profile switch rule:** Stop before touching existing files. Record
  current state and reason here. Confirm new profile explicitly. Flag
  every file needing migration before starting.

## 2026-06-11 — Phase 1 — Augment Humankind PHP Site

### Stack Confirmed
- Built as a no-framework PHP site with clean public routes.
- Public URL structure confirmed before implementation: `/`, `/services`, `/notes`, `/contact`.
- `/contact` uses an email link in v1; a real backend intake form is deferred.

### Schema and Data Decisions
- No database, persistence layer, or schema was added.
- No public API endpoint was added.
- No form submission handling was added.

### Files Created
- `public/index.php` — shared PHP route handler and page rendering for all v1 routes.
- `public/assets/styles.css` — local responsive CSS with accessibility states and no external assets.
- `public/.htaccess` — clean URL rewrite support for Apache-style PHP hosting.
- `public/assets/friendly-guide.png` — URL-safe copy of the existing robot image.

### Vendor Dependencies Added
- None.

### Environment Variables Required
- None.

### Gaps and Deferred Items
- Backend contact form remains deferred pending decisions on storage, spam protection, privacy handling, and email delivery.
- `DESIGN.md` still has no confirmed references or Derived Identity; the v1 visual direction was based on the approved session plan.

### Unresolved Checkpoints Entering Phase 2
- [ ] Decide whether to build the backend contact form.
- [ ] Decide whether to populate `DESIGN.md` with confirmed references before future visual expansion.

## 2026-06-11 — Documentation Maintenance

### Memory and Design Updates
- Added confirmed stack, brand direction, and contact-form boundary entries to `MEMORY.md`.
- Added confirmed mascot-forward Fieldguide observed taste entry to `DESIGN.md`.
- Left `DESIGN.md` References and Derived Identity unfilled because no formal reference workflow has been completed.

### Corrections Applied
- Replaced placeholder `REVIEW REQUIRED` rows with `None currently` to avoid treating template text as active session blockers.
- Expanded `README.md` with the v1 direction, services, routes, and durable-route note.
- Corrected `env.example` to reflect that v1 has no required environment variables.

## 2026-06-11 — Deployment Correction

### Corrections Applied
- Updated the Hostinger FTP workflow to deploy `public/` as the local directory into `/public_html/`.
- Kept production URLs at `/`, `/services`, `/notes`, and `/contact` rather than redirecting visitors into `/public`.
- Noted in `README.md` that deployments should upload `public/` contents to the hosting document root.
- Switched the FTP deploy action to `.ftp-deploy-sync-state-public.json` so it does not reuse the stale sync state from the earlier repository-root upload.
- Documented the intentionally small production file layout and denied direct web access to hidden dotfiles through `.htaccess`.

## REVIEW REQUIRED — Read before starting next session
<!-- Agent writes this block. Human must confirm or override each item before new code is written. -->
- None currently.
